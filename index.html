        <h1>Importance of all instruments in a song</h1>
        <hr>
        <P>
            <i>Drums</i>
            <br>
            These are like the backbone of most songs to keep all other performers/intruments in time.

        <P>
            <i>Bass</i>
            <br>
            A bass or bass line is vital for any song. This provides the low notes that you will harmonize with the melody to take a song the the next level

        <p>
            <i>Melody</i>
            <br>
            The melody is what everyone will hear right away so it must be one of the more important parts of the song whether that be singing or a non-lyrical song
